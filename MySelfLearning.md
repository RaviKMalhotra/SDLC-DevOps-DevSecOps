# Key terms to be used
- we are living in a world of applications. you use many different types of applicaitons throughout your day and night.
- AWS has around 400+ business applications solving diffeent purposes in the industries
- https://opentelemetry.io/
- Microservices, Multi-Microservices, Devopsifying microservices/multi-microservics architecture,
- Microservices can be written using many different programming languages such as Node.js, Java, Python etc...
- Devopsifying different programming language applications
- How to containerized java/pythong/Node.js applications.
- In order to practice devops effectively and efficiently you definatey neeed an application. Now either you can develope your own application or you can use any open source projects with demo application. Some companies provide demo of their applications. some companies open source their applications/demo applications.
- or some companies prepare demo applications as well.
- AWS has a github organization known as AWS Samples, here you can find bunch of demo applications.
- Similiarly Azure, Jenkins have also demo applications. 
- start using app.eraser.io
- An applicatino can be either To-Do applications, either 2 tier or 3 tier applications or web applications. During your interview, do not mention that you have worked on to-do applications or web applications. 
- Any demo application you select for your devops practice, ensure that it has (1) micro services architecture (2) Realtime (3) very good documentation (4) as stable as possible.
- We will pick 'OpenTelemetry' application as a Demo application.

### Project Overview & Basic workflow understanding

### Demo Application - opentelemetry.io [ https://opentelemetry.io/ ]
- Here if you go to Demo and Services section you will see that many different types of programming langauges have been used to develop different microservices.
- as in .NET --> for accounting = process incoming orders and count the sum of all orders.
- as in Java --> for Ads = provides text ads based
- as in .NET --> fo Cart = stores the items in the users shopping cart
- as in Go --> for checkout = Retrieves user cart, prepares order and orchestrates the payment, shipping and the email notification.
- as in C++ --> for currency = Converts one money amount to another currency. uses real values fetched from European central bank. Its the highest QPS service
- as in Ruby --> for email = Sends users an order confirmation email
- as in Elixir --> for flagd-ui = allows toggling and editing of feature flags.
- as in Kotlin --> fraud detection = Analyzes incoming orders and detects fraud attempts
- as in Typescript --> for frontend = exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. does not require sign-up/login and generates Session IDs for all users automatically.
- as python/Locust --> for load-generator = continuously sends requess imitating realistic user shopping flows to the frontend
- as JavaScript --> for payment = charges the given credit card info with the given amount and returns a transaction ID
- as Go --> for product catalog =
- as PHP --> for quotes
- as Python --> for recommendation
- as Rust --> for Shiping
- as TypeScript --> for react-native-app
